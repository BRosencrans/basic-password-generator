# Basic-password-generator

## Description
 This is my first attempt at creating a password genererator, I think i almost got it to work but even though I didn't I still learned a lot in the process

## Usage
when working you can choose between 8 and 128 characters, to randomly generate a password based on what options you choose
you can choose between letters, numbers and special characters

## Credits
Thanks for your time!
